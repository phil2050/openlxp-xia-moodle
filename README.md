Transform: Transforms extracted+validated source learning experience metadata to the configured target schema using the "XSR-to-Target" transformation map stored in the Experience Schema Service (XSS)

Validate: Compares transformed learning experience metadata against the configured target metadata reference schema stored in the Experience Schema Service (XSS).

Load: Pushes transformed and validated learning experience metadata to the target Experience Index Service (XIS) for further processing.
